<h1>Analysis on a tiny datasets.</h1>

How this data set started.

I was creating data on my family to play with data models. Whilsts I was createing the data Christiaan my oldest son was very impressed with the graphing function of Open Office. He continued adding more data to draw bigger charts with more data. We eventually ended up with the current data set. 

As a data scientist I immediately asked the question. What can we predict from this data? Can we predict if someone is Male or female? Can we predict if a person is an adult or a child? 

This notebook will explored predictions on small data sets. It will also highlight the problems associated with small data sets.
